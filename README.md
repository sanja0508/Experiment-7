# Experiment-7

Aim: To write and execute C++ programs using arrays and strings for various applications such as searching, finding highest/lowest values, calculating averages, palindrome checking, reversing strings, and printing elements.

Software Required: Visual Studio (or any C++ compiler such as Code::Blocks, Turbo C++, or Dev C++)

Theory: 
Arrays in C++: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays are used to store lists such as numbers, marks, temperatures, etc. Each element is accessed via its index (starting from 0). Arrays allow efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of bulk data using loops.
Strings in C++: A string is a sequence of characters terminated by a null character \0. In C++, strings can be handled in two ways:
Character arrays (C-style strings)
String class (#include <string>)

Applications:
Arrays and strings are widely used for:
Searching and sorting
Finding max/min values
Summing and averaging
Pattern matching
Palindrome checking
Reversing content

Algorithms:

7a. Finding Number in a Given Array
Start
Input array size and elements
Input the number to search
Traverse the array and compare each element
If found, display index or success message
If not found, display not found message
End

7b. Finding Lowest and Highest Number
Start
Input array size and elements
Initialize lowest and highest to the first element
Traverse the array using a loop
Update lowest and highest when a smaller or larger element is found
Display the lowest and highest
End

7c. Mark Finder
Start
Input roll numbers and corresponding marks into arrays
Input the roll number to be searched
Traverse array to find roll number
If found, display corresponding marks
If not found, display “not found”
End

7d. Create Marks Recorder
Start
Input number of students and subjects
Input marks for each student in all subjects using 2D array
Calculate total and average for each student
Display total, average, and marks
End

7e. Palindrome Checker (String)
Start
Input string
Initialize two pointers: start (0), end (length-1)
Compare characters while moving inward
If all characters match, display "Palindrome"
Else display "Not Palindrome"
End

7f. Printing Array Elements
Start
Input size and elements of array
Traverse and print each element using loop
End

7g. Create String Reverse
Start
Input string
Find length
Swap characters from start and end moving towards the center
Display reversed string
End

7h. Sum and Average of Array Elements
Start
Input array size and elements
Initialize sum = 0
Traverse array, adding each element to sum
Calculate average = sum / size
Display sum and average
End

Implementation Summary: Each task can be implemented with simple loop structures and conditionals. Here's a brief description:
Searching involves comparing each element with the target.
Finding Max/Min involves initializing a variable and updating it as needed.
Palindrome checking and reversing require pointers or index manipulation.
Mark recorders use 2D arrays and nested loops.
Sum/Average is a typical accumulator-based approach.

Conclusion: Through this experiment, we practiced using arrays and strings in C++ for a variety of basic yet essential operations. 
This included:
Searching and comparison
Calculating highest and lowest values
Handling multiple students' marks
Checking palindromes and reversing strings
Calculating sums and averages

These tasks reinforced our understanding of:
Arrays and string data handling
Looping and conditional structures
Efficient use of memory through arrays
Logical thinking for problem-solving in C++

This experiment helps build a strong foundation in C++ programming, especially for handling collections of data and text-based input/output.
